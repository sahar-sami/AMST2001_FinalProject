    <h1>History of Baccalaureate Degrees Conferred at Cornell</h1>
    <div id="intro" style="max-width: 70%">
      <p>
        Today, Cornell confers four types of undergraduate/baccalaureate
        degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor
        of Architecture (B.Arch), and Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.). How have
        these offerings changed over time?

    <h3><b>Methodology:</b></h3>
    <p>
      I collected this data by going through volumes of the Cornell Register
      spanning years 1869 to 1924. For each volume, I went through the section
      detailing the degrees conferred at Commencement and counted the number of
      records. I chose to focus on undergraduate degrees because they had more
      solid categories, and also chose to leave out undergraduate degrees that
      were around for no more than a few years.
